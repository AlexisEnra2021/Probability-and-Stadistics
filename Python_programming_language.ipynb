        "##What is Python?\n",
        "Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn’t specialized for any specific problems. This versatility, along with its beginner-friendliness, has made it one of the most-used programming languages today.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library."

        "##History of Python\n",
        "The history of the Python programming language dates back to the late 80s and early 90s, its implementation began in December 1989 when at Christmas Guido Van Rossum who worked at the (CWI) (an official Dutch research center which, among other things, currently houses the central office of the W3C) decided to start the project as a hobby, continuing the ABC programming language of which he had been part of the development team at the CWI, said language focused on being easy to use. use and learn while maintaining power in its performance but the hardware available at the time of its creation made it difficult to use and the project did not transcend as expected. Van Rossum is therefore the main author of Python and continues to play a central role in deciding the direction of the language, in the Python community he is known as Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL). The name \"Python\" is given by Van Rossum's fondness for the Monty Python group.\n",

        "\n",
        "Python version 1.0 was released in January 1994. The major new features included in this release were the functional programming tools lambda, map, filter and reduce, which Guido Van Rossum never liked.\n",
        "\n",
        "Six and a half years later in October 2000, Python 2.0 was introduced. This release included list comprehensions, a full garbage collector and it was supporting unicode.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python flourished for another 8 years in the versions 2.x before the next major release as Python 3.0 (also known as \"Python 3000\" and \"Py3K\") was released. Python 3 is not backwards compatible with Python 2.x. The emphasis in Python 3 had been on the removal of duplicate programming constructs and modules, thus fulfilling or coming close to fulfilling the 13th law of the Zen of Python: \"There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it.\""
